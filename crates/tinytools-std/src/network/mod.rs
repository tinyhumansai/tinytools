//! Network tools: `http_request`, `web_fetch`, `curl` and `pushover`.
//!
//! Every tool takes an `Arc<dyn NetGate>`: the tool performs the I/O, the
//! host's gate decides whether it may (autonomy, action budget, approval,
//! privacy mode) and how the process-wide proxy is applied. The gate trait
//! ([`NetGate`]) is the whole seam; nothing here knows what an autonomy level,
//! an approval prompt or an egress descriptor is. URL allowlisting and SSRF
//! checks are [`crate::url_guard`]'s.
//!
//! Two more seams keep host-specific behavior out of the tools: a
//! [`PaymentHook`] answers a `402 Payment Required` for `http_request`, and an
//! [`HtmlExtractor`] turns pages into Markdown for `web_fetch`.

// These tools moved here verbatim from a host crate; their behavior, messages
// and control flow are pinned by tests and by the fixtures in `fixtures/`, so
// the purely stylistic pedantic lints below are allowed rather than reshaping
// working code (long `execute` bodies, `usize as f64` size labels, and so on).

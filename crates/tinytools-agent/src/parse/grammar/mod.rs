//! The surface syntaxes a tool call can arrive in, one module each.
//!
//! A grammar answers one question: *starting at a byte offset, where is the
//! next block I recognise, and what calls does it hold?* It does not know
//! about protected ranges, about other grammars, or about how the narrative
//! text is assembled — that is the scan engine in [`crate::parse`]. Keeping
//! grammars this narrow is what makes adding one a local change: a new file
//! here, a line in [`GRAMMARS`], and every caller — batch, streaming, every
//! dialect — sees it.
//!
//! Order in [`GRAMMARS`] only breaks ties between grammars whose openers sit
//! at the same byte; the engine otherwise takes the earliest opener.

//! End-to-end tool calling for a host that drives its own model loop.
//!
//! [`super`] answers *"what did the model ask for"*. This module answers
//! everything around it: how the model is **told** to ask, how results are
//! **rendered** back, and how a transcript is **replayed** onto the provider
//! wire so the next iteration is well-formed. Together those are one thing —
//! a **dialect** — and they have to move together, because a catalogue that
//! advertises one grammar and a parser that expects another is a silent
//! whole-turn failure with no error anywhere.
//!
//! Four dialects ship: [`XmlDialect`] (JSON in a tag), [`PFormatDialect`]
//! (compact positional), [`CodeDialect`] (a Python or TypeScript function
//! call), and [`NativeDialect`] (the provider's structured channel).
//!
//! This module speaks [`TranscriptEntry`], a deliberately thin record shape a
//! host maps onto in a few `From` impls. It does not assume a provider message
//! type or anything about how and when the host calls the model.
//!
//! The second case is not a lesser one. A host with years of persisted
//! transcripts, per-turn security policy, and provider quirks encoded in its
//! own storage cannot adopt a foreign message model just to stop maintaining a
//! tool-call parser — and the parser is the part that is genuinely universal.
//! This module is the seam that lets it hand over the universal part alone.
//!
//! # What stays with the host
//!
//! Executing a tool: permission checks, sandboxing, approval gates, timeouts,
//! progress events. A dialect decides what the model *reads and writes*; it
//! never decides what is allowed to *happen*. That boundary is what keeps a
//! host's security policy in the host, where it can be audited.
